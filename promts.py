   - Maintain a professional, authoritative tone appropriate for technical content.

   - Propose 2-3 relevant external links to authoritative sources.
   - Include a call-to-action (CTA) at the end of the post.

5. FINAL CHECKS:
    
   - Ensure the content is 100 original and not copied from the example(s) like dont use the same website name in our posts.
