# Nothing Phone 2a Plus Review: An Unnecessary Upgrade?

The Nothing Phone 2a Plus aims to bridge the gap between the standard Phone 2a and the flagship Phone 2. However, this new mid-range offering from Nothing falls short of justifying its price premium over its younger sibling. Let's dive into why this incremental update may not be worth the extra investment.

## Design and Build: Subtle Refinements, Same Materials

Nothing has made minor aesthetic tweaks to the Phone 2a Plus, giving it a more sophisticated look with glossier internal coiling and more pronounced textures. However, the device still uses a plastic frame and back panel, which feels underwhelming at this price point. Competitors like the Motorola Edge 50 Pro offer metal frames, making the Phone 2a Plus feel less premium in comparison.

## Display: Missed Opportunity for Upgrade

The 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED display remains unchanged from the Phone 2a. While it's a capable panel, the lack of improvement is disappointing, especially when rivals are offering curved 1.5K displays in this segment. The Gorilla Glass 5 protection also lags behind some competitors using more advanced Victus glass.

## Performance: Marginal Gains

The Phone 2a Plus sports a MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro chipset, offering about a 10% performance boost over the Phone 2a's Dimensity 7200 Pro. While this provides a slight edge in benchmarks and gaming, the real-world difference is minimal. The clean Nothing OS experience remains smooth, but the hardware upgrade feels incremental at best.

## Cameras: Mixed Results

The rear camera setup is identical to the Phone 2a, delivering good results in various lighting conditions. However, the new 50MP selfie camera is surprisingly less consistent than its predecessor, often producing washed-out or blurry shots. This regression in front-facing camera performance is puzzling and disappointing.

## Battery and Charging: Minor Improvements

The 5000mAh battery capacity remains unchanged, but charging speeds have been bumped up to 50W from 45W. This results in only marginally faster charging times. The addition of 5W reverse wired charging is a nice touch, but not a game-changer.

## Verdict: A Hard Sell

The Nothing Phone 2a Plus struggles to justify its price premium over the standard Phone 2a. With only minor upgrades in processor and design, and no significant improvements in display or build quality, it's difficult to recommend over its cheaper sibling or similarly priced competitors offering more compelling features.

For those seeking the Nothing experience, the original Phone 2a or even the budget CMF Phone 1 offer better value. The Phone 2a Plus, while not a bad device, ultimately feels like an unnecessary addition to Nothing's lineup that most users can safely skip.
